# iTCGA_Workshop_Salicornia_Eutrophication
In this project we compare the effects of ammonium and nitrate on root growth and flower production in Salicornia depressa. Analyze how nitrogen availability influences gene expression to uncover insights into nutrient uptake mechanisms, stress tolerance, and reproductive fitness.
